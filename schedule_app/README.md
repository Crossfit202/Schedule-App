# Overview

My app is a scheduling app that helps people plan their events around the weather. You can add an event in the calendar and go to the weather screen to see what times it's supposed to rain.

I scooter to the library to do my homework when the weather is nice and I wanted an app that can help me know when I should plan on going and how to adjust my schedule since it's dependent on the weather.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code and Android Studio to emulate a phone. I was also able to use my own phone and load the app on it to test.

I used Flutter, Dart, and a few packages. syncfusion_flutter_calendar, shared_preferences.

# Useful Websites

These are the websites that I found useful.

- [Syncfusion Calendar pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_calendar)
- [Installing Flutter and setting up environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFDbZk2xhO4&t=139s)
- [Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)

# Future Work

There are a few things I would like to add in the future

- I would like to make the background color of an event dependent on the forecasted weather condition. If it is forecasted to rain at the time you creat the event, it will make the background color red and have other colors for other conditions. This way users don't have to make events and then check the weather on the other screen or the other way around.
- I would like to set up notifications that get sent to the user if an event that wasn't in an expected rain slot becomes a time that it is forecasted to rain.
  -I want to make it so that users can switch from week view and month view and day view.
